# DECISIONS

> Dated decision log. Mirrors the plan's §2 "Locked Decisions" and §15, plus any new
> decisions made during implementation. Newest at the bottom.

## 2026-06-01 — Phase 0 foundations

- **Manual Nx scaffold** (not `create-nx-workspace`): the repo already had git history +
  `LICENSE`; a manual package-based pnpm-workspace setup gives exact control over the §3 tree and
  avoids interactive generator prompts during autonomous work.
- **Package manager: pnpm** (locked, §2). Root is a pnpm workspace (`packages/*`, `apps/*`, `e2e`).
- **Nx Cloud OFF** (locked, §2): no `nxCloudAccessToken`, no cloud runner; local + CI cache only.
- **Nx Release**: `projectsRelationship: "fixed"` (one synced version), `version.conventionalCommits: true`,
  workspace changelog `createRelease: "github"`, project changelogs on. Tag pattern `v{version}`.
- **TS config**: ES2024 target, ESNext module, `moduleResolution: bundler`, strict + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`,
  `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `verbatimModuleSyntax`, `isolatedModules`. ESM-only output (§13).
- **Module boundaries** enforced by scope tags (`scope:core|localizer|styles|dnd|ui|tooling`) encoding the
  §3 dependency direction (core→localizer; ui→core/styles/dnd/localizer; styles→nothing; dnd→core).
- **Conventional commits** mandatory via commitlint + Husky `commit-msg`; scope-enum warns (level 1) on
  the known package/scope list.
- **Versions**: latest stable at scaffold time per §13 (nx 22.7, TS 6.0, Vite 8, Vitest 4, ESLint 10,
  typescript-eslint 8.60, @preact/signals-core 1.14).

## Inherited from the plan (already locked — see Upgrade_plan_prompt.md §2/§15)

- Localizers: Temporal (default) + Luxon only; moment/dayjs/date-fns/globalize dropped.
- Public date type: strings only (strict RFC 3339/9557); no `Date` at the boundary.
- UI text: `messages` map in `core`, English defaults, overridable. No separate i18n package.
- Styling: all in `@big-calendar/styles`; framework packages ship no CSS.
- RTL: CSS `:dir()` + logical properties; no `rtl` prop. (`as`/polymorphic prop dropped entirely.)
- Signals: `@preact/signals-core` in `core`; framework bridges shipped inside each UI package.
- React first and alone in the base; Vue→Angular→Lit added one at a time afterward.
- Execution: autonomous on `feat/initial`, commit+push often, no PRs.

## 2026-06-01 — Phase 1 Task 1a: localizer base architecture

- **Template-method design:** `Localizer<T>` (abstract) implements the *entire* `LocalizerContract`
  (all ~40 string-in/string-out methods) on top of a **small `protected abstract` primitive set**
  (`parse`, `serialize`, `toEpochMs`, `getParts`, `addUnits`, `startOfUnit`, `endOfUnit`, `diffUnits`,
  `withTime`, `offsetMinutes`). Concrete localizers (Temporal/Luxon) implement only the primitives, so
  all locale/week/format logic lives once in the base and every localizer behaves identically.
  `T` (internal datetime type) never escapes the public surface; `core` types against `LocalizerContract`.
- **weekday convention = ISO-8601 `1=Mon … 7=Sun`** across `DateParts.weekday`, `firstDayOfWeek`, and
  `weekInfo.firstDay` — matches `Intl.Locale` weekInfo and Temporal `dayOfWeek` (no 0-based JS `getDay`).
- **`firstDayOfWeek` resolution (resolved 2026-06-02):** explicit override option → locale
  `weekInfo.firstDay` (native or ponyfilled) → **Monday (1)** as the last-resort fallback. Per user
  direction: default to locale, fall back to Monday, allow an override argument. The earlier `?? 7`
  (Sunday) last-resort was changed to `?? 1`; this aligns the unreachable base-class fallback with the
  ponyfill's own CLDR "001" no-region default (Monday) and supersedes the plan's "fallback Sunday" prose.
  Because §5 guarantees weekInfo via ponyfill, the fallback remains effectively unreachable — locale
  values still drive real behavior (e.g. en-US resolves to Sunday=7 via weekInfo).
- **Slot/minute math is wall-clock, not instant-based:** `getMinutesFromMidnight` uses wall-clock
  `hour*60+minute` and `getSlotDate` uses `withTime`, so a DST day still maps minute-630 ↔ 10:30 wall
  time (grid slots are wall-clock). `getTotalMin`/`getDstOffset` remain instant-based (real elapsed).
- **Ponyfill guarantee (§5/§15.3):** `getWeekInfo` and `formatDuration` feature-detect the native
  `Intl` API and fall back (CLDR region table / `NumberFormat`+`ListFormat`) when absent.

## 2026-06-01 — Phase 1 Task 1b: Temporal polyfill choice

- **Polyfill = `temporal-polyfill` (v0.3.2)**, not `@js-temporal/polyfill`. Lighter bundle (matches
  §15.10 "monitor Temporal polyfill weight"), spec-compliant. Loaded **lazily** via dynamic `import()`
  behind a `globalThis.Temporal` feature-detect, so native hosts pay zero polyfill cost (§5.2). It is a
  regular runtime `dependency` of `localizer-temporal` only and stays external in the Vite build.
- **Async construction:** the localizer needs `Temporal` synchronously in its methods, so the public
  entry is an async factory `createTemporalLocalizer(options)` that resolves the namespace (native or
  polyfilled) and injects it into the `TemporalLocalizer` constructor.
- **`TemporalAPI` typed as a hand-written structural interface** (not `typeof import(...).Temporal`):
  the `import()` type expression violates the `consistent-type-imports` ESLint rule. The narrow
  interface (`Instant`/`ZonedDateTime`/`PlainDate` `.from`) is what the full namespace structurally
  assigns to.

## 2026-06-01 — Phase 1 Task 1c: CSS layout/top-layer support floor (spike)

> Full report: `memory/spikes/phase1-css-layout.md`. Spike was a **desk review** vs. the Jan-2026
> platform-knowledge cutoff (no live browser run); empirical Playwright verification deferred to Phase 3.

- **Support floor = Baseline 2024 (no pre-2024 fallbacks).** Per user direction (2026-06-02): we support
  no engine released before 2024 and do **not** spend effort on pre-2024 fallbacks. Subgrid, Popover API,
  and CSS `:dir()` are all cross-engine inside that floor and are **adopted unconditionally** as primary
  mechanisms (month/time-grid alignment via subgrid; top layer via Popover; RTL via `:dir()` + logical
  properties — confirms **no `rtl` prop**). The earlier per-capability "older-engine" fallbacks
  (flat-grid for subgrid, JS portal for top layer, `[dir="rtl"]` selectors) are **dropped.**
- **CSS Anchor Positioning — excluded, but NOT as a back-compat concern.** It is the one capability still
  not cross-engine in *current* browsers (Chromium-only in stable; Safari/Firefox not yet shipped as of
  the Jan-2026 cutoff — flagged uncertain). **Decision: do NOT depend on it.** `@floating-ui/core` is the
  **permanent default** positioning engine for tethered top-layer elements (already a
  `@big-calendar/react` dep, §11) — confirmed with the user 2026-06-02. Native `anchor()` may be added
  later as a feature-detected progressive enhancement once it is cross-engine. Division of labor:
  floating-ui does **positioning**, the Popover API does **top-layer stacking** — complementary.

## 2026-06-02 — End of Phase 2 core logic; 2m + selection-wiring deferred to Phase 4

- **Phase 2 core logic = COMPLETE** (sub-tasks 2a–2l): all 5 view models, layout algos, navigation/
  drilldown/range, accessors, resource grouping, selection FSM, messages, derived `viewModel` store
  signal + parity config, background events. 168 Vitest cases, per-file bar met, build green.
- **2m — view registry (custom views): DEFERRED to Phase 4.** Per Cutter (2026-06-02). Rationale: a
  custom view's model shape can't be settled without the framework view-component contract, and
  `CalendarViewModel` is a closed `month|time|agenda` union. Building the registry now would be a
  speculative abstraction (violates CLAUDE.md simplest-first / ask-before-architecture). Revisit once
  the React view-component contract exists; the registry + custom-view model escape-hatch are designed
  together then.
- **Store-level selection wiring: DEFERRED to Phase 4 (with the React adapter).** Per Cutter
  (2026-06-02): the split is confirmed — the selection **FSM lives in `core`** (done, 2h, slot-index
  space); the **adapter** owns slot-index↔date mapping (month = day cells; time-grid = (column, slot)
  2D) and `beginSlotSelection`. **This split MUST be well documented in Storybook** (Cutter's explicit
  ask) — the React Storybook explains how an adapter drives the core FSM and maps coordinates.
- **Next: Phase 3 — Styles** (`@big-calendar/styles`), per §14 roadmap.

## 2026-06-02 — Phase 3 (Styles) complete

- **`@big-calendar/styles` authored** (tokens, reset, layout, components/*, index bundle) per §6:
  Baseline-2024 CSS, `@layer bc.{reset,tokens,layout,components,theme,overrides}`, all visual values
  as overridable `--bc-*` tokens (system-color defaults via `color-mix` → auto light/dark), month via
  **nested subgrid**, logical properties + `:dir()` for RTL (confirmed **no `rtl` prop**), `@container`
  (not viewport) responsive, native Popover for top layer.
- **Geometry contract locked** (the bridge core→CSS, documented in `packages/styles/VOCABULARY.md`):
  events use `--bc-top/height/left/width` fractions + `--bc-z`; month/all-day segments use
  `--bc-seg-left/span/row` grid spans; now-line `--bc-now-top`. The React adapter (Phase 4) sets these
  inline from core's normalized output and attaches the documented `.bc-*` class names — **framework
  packages ship no CSS** (§6 boundary).
- **Granular exports**: `reset.css` / `tokens.css` / `layout.css` / `components/*.css` / `index.css`;
  each file self-wraps its `bc.*` layer so standalone imports stay correctly layered.
- **Not done in this env:** no browser render / visual-regression (none available) and no CSS linter
  (ESLint is TS-only). `spike/index.html` is authored for manual/Storybook verification; empirical
  subgrid/anchor/visual checks ride with Phase 4/7.

## 2026-06-02 — Phase 4 React state model = HYBRID

- **Cutter chose the HYBRID controlled/uncontrolled model** for `@big-calendar/react` (the canonical
  contract all future Vue/Angular/Lit mirror): uncontrolled by default (store owns state, seeded by
  `defaultView`/`defaultDate`; `useCalendar` returns the store), opt into control per-prop by passing
  `view`/`date` + wiring `onView`/`onNavigate`. Controlled values are written straight to the signals
  (no callback re-fire); `events`/`backgroundEvents`/`resources` always sync.
- Implemented in `useCalendar` (task 4b). Also widened `CalendarConfig` optionals to `?: T | undefined`
  (exactOptional pass-through) so adapters forward props cleanly.
- STILL OPEN (Cutter to decide next): `<Calendar>` component vocabulary + `components` override map
  (§7), top-layer popover components (§7.5), selection wiring + its Storybook docs, and the 2m view
  registry.

## 2026-06-02 — Phase 4 React component/API contract (the canonical framework contract)

Settled with Cutter (AskUserQuestion + follow-ups). All future Vue/Angular/Lit adapters mirror this.

- **Shell = HYBRID** (matches §7.1 "Exports: `<Calendar>`, all sub-components"): a batteries-included
  `<Calendar>` for the common/novice path **and** standalone exports (view components, etc.) for full
  composition. Tree-shakeable (compose only what you import) — aligns with the bundle-size priority
  Cutter raised re: resources/selection packaging.
- **Override model = BOTH** (matches §7 L254 "`components` prop / render props"): a `components`
  override map is the primary API (v1 parity → easiest migration); render-prop functions are the
  escape hatch where a function fits better (e.g. show-more content). Type-safe, framework-native.
- **Context REQUIRED, and it WRAPS `<Calendar>` (it is not created inside it).** Per Cutter:
  `CalendarProvider` is the outer container that owns the store (via `useCalendar`) and publishes it on
  `CalendarContext`. `<Calendar>` and any **sibling** components (custom toolbars, sidebars, mini-maps)
  render *inside* the provider and share one store. `<Calendar>` therefore **consumes** context rather
  than creating its own. `useCalendarContext` throws outside a provider, which enforces this for every
  calendar component automatically.
- **Context kept minimal (Appendix A.6):** the context value carries only `store` for now; `messages`
  and the resolved `components` map join the value when their first real consumers (Toolbar /
  overridable Event) land — not before (A.6: promote to context only once a concrete consumer exists).
- **React 18 floor** (peerDeps `react >=18`, CLAUDE.md): use `Context.Provider`/`useContext`/`forwardRef`;
  avoid React-19-only APIs (`<Context>` as provider, `use()`, ref-as-prop).
- Build order: 4c provider+context → view components (consume context + `store.viewModel`) + Toolbar/
  Event with overrides → `<Calendar>` default tree → top-layer (§7.5) → selection wiring (+Storybook).

## 2026-06-02 — Touch support is a first-class design requirement (cross-cutting)

Per Cutter: the calendar must **support touch for use on tablets and phones** — explicitly, not just
"responsive." Responsive (container queries, Phase 3) sizes the *layout*; touch is orthogonal (a tablet
is large **and** touch). The plan implied touch (§8 "pointer + keyboard" FSM, `longPressThreshold`,
pragmatic-DnD's touch path) but never stated it as a requirement. Now it is.

- **Pointer Events, unified** — adapters bind `pointerdown/move/up` (not separate mouse+touch); set CSS
  `touch-action` on selectable/draggable surfaces so slot-drag / event-drag don't fight page scroll.
- **Coarse-pointer adaptations** (`@media (pointer: coarse)` / `(hover: none)`): ≥44×44px hit targets;
  **no hover-only affordances** — show-more, resize handles, tooltips must be tap-reachable.
- **Long-press to begin selection** on touch (the in-scope `longPressThreshold`, adapter-timed) vs
  immediate mouse drag; disambiguate **scroll-vs-select** in the time grid.
- **Touch DnD** — wire pragmatic-drag-and-drop's touch path + `touch-action: none` on drag handles.
- **Scope:** touches the **adapter + styles ONLY, never `core`** — the selection FSM is already
  pointer-agnostic (slot indices). Lands in Phase 4 (4g top-layer tap targets, 4h selection
  long-press/`touch-action`, DnD touch) + a **coarse-pointer pass on the already-built styles package**
  (current `@big-calendar/styles` has no `pointer: coarse` target-sizing yet — follow-up).
- a11y note: keyboard model (§7.6) is unchanged; touch is additive, not a replacement.

## 2026-06-02 — Labels in core; per-event time strings adapter-side

- **View label → CORE** (Cutter chose this): `store.label` computed via `viewLabel` so every adapter
  renders the identical localized title. Done (task 4d).
- **Per-event time strings → ADAPTER** (my call, flagged for Cutter): a shared, separately-tested
  `formatEventTime` helper in `@big-calendar/react` formats event times for display. Rationale: the raw
  events already reach the adapter (a custom event component needs them), and enriching every event in
  every view model with formatted strings is heavier than one shared formatter. **Open to revisiting** —
  if cross-framework parity of event-time formatting matters, promote `formatEventTime` to a core/shared
  util. Title/allDay are trivial accessor reads done inline in the adapter.

## 2026-06-03 — Per-day "now"/state via store.getNow() (not in the view model)

- **DECISION (Cutter):** MonthView's today highlight (and the upcoming time-grid now-indicator) get
  "now" from a newly-exposed **`store.getNow()`** on the public `CalendarStore` (sibling to
  `localizer`/`accessors`; was internal-only, used by `navigate`). The adapter derives `isToday`
  (`localizer.isSameDate`) and `isOffRange` (`localizer.neq({unit:'month'})` vs the focus date) itself.
- **What was rejected:** enriching every view model with per-day `isToday`/`isOffRange` (and a now-fraction
  for time grid). Rejected to keep view-model shapes lean and avoid baking display semantics into core;
  the single primitive `getNow` is reusable by all views and the now-indicator.
- **Coupled change:** surfaced `config.weekEventLimit` and threaded it into the store's `viewModel`
  computed — it was plumbed through `monthViewModel`/`buildViewModel` but the store never passed it, so
  the month "+N more" overflow path was unreachable. Supersedes the 2j note that said month
  `weekEventLimit` is "left unlimited from the store."

## 2026-06-03 — TimeGridView: resolved step/timeslots on the store for now-indicator alignment

- **DECISION (my call, flagged for Cutter):** exposed resolved **`store.step`** and **`store.timeslots`**
  on the public `CalendarStore` (siblings to `getNow`). The time-grid now-line is derived adapter-side
  (per the getNow decision) by rebuilding `createSlotMetrics` on today's column and calling
  `getCurrentTimePosition(getNow())`. To land the line on the *same* vertical span the model used for
  event boxes (`span = step * numSlots`, which can exceed the raw `[min,max]` window when it isn't a
  whole number of slot groups), the adapter needs the resolved `step`/`timeslots` — so they're exposed
  rather than re-guessing the defaults.
- **Implementation:** resolved once in `createCalendarStore` (`config.step ?? 30`, `config.timeslots ?? 2`)
  and threaded into the viewModel options as the single source of truth (previously the options passed
  raw `config.step`/`config.timeslots` and the defaults lived only inside the view builders).
- **What was rejected:** (a) computing the now-fraction in core/the view model — rejected to keep the
  model "now"-free and pure; (b) approximating the fraction adapter-side from `min`/`max` alone via
  `getMinutesFromMidnight` — rejected because it can misalign with event boxes near the window edge when
  the window isn't a whole number of slot groups.

## 2026-06-03 — Test date handling: real localizers only, dual-localizer parity (base decision, Cutter)

- **DECISION (Cutter):** Tests never use JS `Date` for date logic. All date math/formatting in tests goes
  through a **real** Big Calendar localizer — **no mocked/faked localizers** outside the `localizer`
  package. `Date` is allowed *only* to mint mock RFC-3339 primitive strings or seed fixtures, never for
  assertions or arithmetic.
- **Parity scope (Cutter, corrected from "non-core" → "non-localizer"):** every package **except**
  `@big-calendar/localizer` (`core`, `react`, future framework packages) runs its date-dependent tests
  against **both** shipped localizers — `localizer-temporal` **and** `localizer-luxon` — via a
  parameterized suite (`describe.each([temporal, luxon])`); a behavior passes only when it passes
  identically under both. The `localizer` package tests its own abstract base class directly. Tests pin
  `timezone` (e.g. UTC) and pass `getNow` explicitly for determinism.
- **Sequencing (Cutter: "adopt rule, defer retrofit"):** `localizer-temporal` is **built and usable**
  (1b ✓; `createTemporalLocalizer()` async-loads the Temporal namespace), but `localizer-luxon` is only a
  **scaffold** (`PACKAGE_NAME` + smoke test, no `LuxonLocalizer` class), so the *dual*-localizer parity
  requirement can't be met yet. The rule is recorded now but the existing **cast-fakes stay as a stopgap**
  in the 6 non-localizer react test files (`useCalendar`, `CalendarProvider`, `Toolbar`, `AgendaView`,
  `MonthView`, `TimeGridView`) and in `core`. They are retrofitted to the dual-localizer pattern **once
  `localizer-luxon` is implemented** (§5.3). Acknowledged tech debt, flagged for retrofit. `<Calendar>`
  proceeds first.
  - **Correction:** an earlier draft of this entry said "the concrete localizer packages don't exist /
    base is non-instantiable" — wrong. Temporal exists and works; only Luxon is unimplemented.
- **Execution plan (Cutter, 2026-06-03):** retrofit **interim to real temporal NOW** (don't wait for luxon).
  Order **react 6 → core 10 → `<Calendar>`**. Assertion style: **read expected text from the real
  `localizer.format(value, preset)` output** (not hardcoded en-US ICU literals, not formats-overrides) —
  faithful to wiring, robust to ICU/Node data drift; geometry/counts/`bc-today`/drilldown stay exact UTC
  values. Harness = shared per-package helper, `await createTemporalLocalizer({ locale:'en-US',
  timezone:'UTC' })` in `beforeAll`, built as a `describe.each` array so the luxon arm slots in later.
  Step 0 before converting: smoke-test that the temporal dist + its dynamic `temporal-polyfill` import
  resolve under Vitest, and add `@big-calendar/localizer-temporal` as a devDependency to `react`/`core`.
  **Checkpointed here before starting any conversion (usage budget).**
- **Plan:** recorded in `Upgrade_plan_prompt.md` — new §2 Locked-Decisions row ("Test date handling") and
  new **§5.5 Localizer testing policy**.
- **What was rejected:** keeping exhaustive temporal-vs-luxon parity *only* in the localizer package while
  view tests use a single default localizer — rejected by Cutter: `core` and every non-localizer consumer
  must themselves prove parity against both real localizers, not delegate it.
- **Outcome / first catch (2026-06-03, commits `b692032` + `ce8f640`):** step 0 + react 6 + **core 4 of 10**
  (`slotMetrics`, `timeGrid`, `viewModel`, `createCalendarStore`) done. The real localizer immediately
  exposed a **sign bug in `core/createSlotMetrics.positionFromDate`** — it called `diff()` with `a`/`b`
  swapped (`min − date`), negating every timed-event top, all-day/background offset, and the now-indicator;
  the hand-rolled fakes implemented `diff` as `b − a`, **exactly canceling** the bug so all suites were
  green against fakes. Fixed to `diff({ a: date, b: min })` (with `getDstOffset` now on the correct sign).
  Cutter chose **fix core now + pull the 4 affected core files forward**. This is the concrete justification
  for the no-fakes policy. Remaining core 6 (`resources`, `month`, `agenda`, `viewLabel`, `navigateDate`,
  `viewRange`) still use fakes (green) and convert next. **Gotcha:** react tests resolve `@big-calendar/core`
  from its built `dist`, so core src fixes need `pnpm nx build core` before react tests see them.
- **Outcome / completion + second catch (2026-06-03):** core 6 converted — all 10 core test files now run
  against the real `TemporalLocalizer`. `resources` needed no change (no localizer fake; pure accessor
  grouping). `viewRange` keeps the original dual-week-start coverage by running work-week under both `en-US`
  (Sunday-first, the harness default) and `en-GB` (Monday-first, via `create({locale:'en-GB'})`, since
  `firstDayOfWeek` resolves from locale `weekInfo`). The `month` conversion exposed **BUG #2, same class as
  the slotMetrics one**: `core/views/segments.function.ts` built `slots` and the multi-day `span` with
  `diff()` args swapped, so `slots` went negative and every multi-day month segment collapsed to `span:1`.
  The `makeMonthLocalizer` fake's `diff = b − a` canceled it, and single-day events (span 1 regardless) hid
  it from every other test. Fixed both call sites to put the later bound in `a`
  (`diff({a:end,b:start})` for span, `diff({a:last,b:first})` for slots) — consistent with the established
  "fix core now" precedent. Net: the retrofit caught **two** real production sign bugs, both rooted in the
  fakes implementing `diff` as `b − a` against the contract's `a − b`. Localizer retrofit COMPLETE;
  `<Calendar>` is next. Luxon arm still deferred until `localizer-luxon` exists.

## 2026-06-03 — Serialization: canonical UTC-`Z`, offset opt-in (SUPERSEDES the `+00:00` behavior)

- **Decision (Cutter):** the localizer's serialized instant is **canonical UTC terminated with `Z`** by default
  — `2026-06-03T10:30:00Z`, or `…Z[America/Los_Angeles]` when `extendedZone`. A new instance option
  `output: 'utc' | 'offset'` (default `'utc'`) lets an app opt into local-offset wire format
  (`…±hh:mm`, or `…±hh:mm[Zone]`). **Supersedes** the prior implicit behavior where `serialize` emitted a
  numeric offset (`+00:00` in UTC) via `dt.toString({timeZoneName:'never'})` / `dt.toString()`.
- **Rationale:** a calendar date is an absolute instant; it always needs a UTC/epoch reference, and the IANA
  zone is only the *display* lens (DST-aware). So values are never zoneless — both forms carry `Z`; the
  bracket is metadata. Per-value "mirror the input format" was rejected: `parse` normalizes into the
  localizer timezone and discards the input's textual form, so mirroring would require threading raw strings
  through the whole base class, has no defined meaning for multi/zero-input methods (`min`/`max`/`getNow`),
  and reintroduces the offset-vs-`Z` ambiguity. An instance-level flag matches how `timezone`/`locale`/
  `extendedZone` already work.
- **Implementation:** option added to `LocalizerOptions` + `LocalizerContract` (readonly) + base `Localizer`
  (`this.output = options.output ?? 'utc'`). Only `TemporalLocalizer.serialize` changed: `body =
  output==='offset' ? dt.toString({timeZoneName:'never'}) : dt.toInstant().toString()`, then append
  `[${dt.timeZoneId}]` when `extendedZone`. **Parse untouched** — verified `Instant.from` already accepts
  `Z`, `+00:00`, `-07:00`, and `…Z[Zone]`, all to the same instant. (`Instant.toString()` also drops the
  `.000` trailing zeros, so outputs are `…00Z`, not `…00.000Z`.)
- **Verified gotcha for the future Luxon adapter:** `DateTime.fromISO('…Z[America/Los_Angeles]')` returns
  `isValid:true` but the **wrong instant** (off by the zone offset — it reads the wall digits as local and
  discards `Z`). The luxon adapter MUST IXDTF-split the bracket and parse the instant separately
  (`fromISO(isoPart, { zone })`), and its `serialize` must compose `…Z` + `[zone]` by hand (Luxon's
  `toISO()` emits offset, never `Z`/bracket). Temporal needs no such workaround.
- **Tests:** `localizer-temporal.class.test.ts` keeps its NY wall-clock assertions readable by constructing
  those localizers with `output:'offset'` (reproduces prior output exactly), plus a new "output modes" block
  covering `utc` default (`…Z`), `…Z[Zone]`, offset mode, and mixed-input→same-instant. Base
  `localizer.class.test.ts` asserts the `output` default/override. Retrofitted core/react suites read values
  back from the localizer, so they're format-agnostic and unaffected.

## 2026-06-03 — `<Calendar>` shape, Toolbar outside `.bc-calendar`, reset re-scope, Storybook order

**Status: IMPLEMENTED 2026-06-03** (Phase 4 Task 4h — see PROGRESS.md). Built in the approved order
(CSS → Storybook → `<Calendar>`); all gates green. The two open Storybook questions below were
resolved by Cutter before install — see "Storybook layout (resolved)".

- **`<Calendar>` is a context CONSUMER**, not a provider — rendered inside `<CalendarProvider>` (the
  provider's docstring already commits to this). Generic over `<TEvent, TResource>`. Sole own prop:
  `toolbar?: boolean`, default `true`.
- **Render shape (locked):** a fragment, NOT a wrapping element —
  `<>{toolbar ? <Toolbar/> : null}<div className="bc-calendar">{active view}</div></>`. The Toolbar is a
  **sibling OUTSIDE** `.bc-calendar`. Active view picked by `viewModel.kind`
  (`month`→`MonthView`, `time`→`TimeGridView`, `agenda`→`AgendaView`); the views keep their existing
  internal `kind`-mismatch null-guards as a safety net.
- **No shell wrapper (Cutter, explicit):** `.bc-calendar` styles/sizes only the calendar (views), filling
  100% w/h of its parent. `.bc-toolbar` owns its own layout/styling. Any container that stacks toolbar +
  calendar (e.g. fixed-height `auto 1fr`) is **developer-supplied at app level** — Big Calendar does not
  emit one. The Toolbar must work both standalone-in-provider and as `<Calendar>`'s sibling.
- **Why this surfaced a CSS bug:** the existing `@big-calendar/styles` baked the toolbar *into*
  `.bc-calendar` — `layout.css` had `.bc-calendar { grid-template-rows: auto 1fr }` (row 1 = toolbar,
  row 2 = view) and `reset.css` scoped the entire reset under `.bc-calendar` only. Moving the toolbar
  outside breaks both: the view would land in the `auto` row (stops filling) and a standalone toolbar
  would lose the reset (host box-sizing/fonts/focus leak in).
- **CSS fix (approved verbatim, do FIRST):**
  - `reset.css`: reset root `.bc-calendar` → `:is(.bc-calendar, .bc-toolbar)` across all selectors.
  - `layout.css`: `.bc-calendar` `grid-template-rows: auto 1fr` → `1fr`; keep `block-size:100%` +
    `container: bc / inline-size`.
- **Custom-toolbar reset = opt-in (Cutter's choice):** the reset covers the built-in `DefaultToolbar`
  (root `.bc-toolbar`). A `components.toolbar` override renders its own root with an unknown class and is
  the dev's responsibility to scope (use `.bc-toolbar`, or render inside `.bc-calendar`) — consistent with
  how custom slot components already attach the style classes. No DOM wrapper is added by the `Toolbar`
  wrapper component.
- **Storybook order (Cutter):** after the CSS fix, stand up a LIGHT Storybook *before* writing
  `<Calendar>`, so progress is visible as the rest of the plan proceeds. Scope: "API stub of base +
  React instances, early React stories only" → stories only for the already-built React components
  (Toolbar, MonthView, TimeGridView, AgendaView). New stack: Vite 8 → `@storybook/react-vite`, pnpm.
  Structure is already implied by `nx.json` (per-project `.storybook/` + co-located `*.stories.*`, both
  already excluded from the `production` namedInputs). The legacy `docs-site.md` memory (webpack/yarn/
  MDX, 150+ prop stories, port 9002) describes the OLD react-big-calendar and is reference only, NOT the
  new toolchain.
- **Storybook layout (resolved by Cutter 2026-06-03, the two formerly-open questions):**
  - (a) **Per-package `.storybook/` config**, but ALL stories and `.mdx` docs live in a
    `packages/<pkg>/stories/` folder (NOT co-located next to components). `nx.json` production inputs
    gained `!{projectRoot}/stories/**/*` so plain `.mdx` docs there (not matched by the `*.stories.*`
    glob) stay out of build/typecheck cache inputs.
  - (b) **"API stub of base" = a Placeholder/Welcome page** for the headless `@big-calendar/core`
    (`stories/Welcome.mdx`), not a full API doc — the real core API reference is a later pass.
- **As-built (Task 4h):** `storybook` + `@storybook/react-vite` + `@storybook/addon-docs` `^10.4.2`
  (SB10 supports Vite 8 + React 18/19) as root devDeps. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `allowBuilds: esbuild:
  true` (pnpm 11 build-script approval; SB's Vite builder needs esbuild's postinstall). Core got
  react/react-dom as dev-only deps so its docs Storybook renders via react-vite. Stories cover Toolbar,
  MonthView, TimeGridView, AgendaView, and (added once it existed) Calendar. The `<Calendar>` prop type
  shipped as `toolbar?: boolean | undefined` (the `| undefined` required by `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`);
  no `CalendarProps` interface was added for it — that name is already the public config type from
  `useCalendar.ts`, so the single prop is inlined to avoid a clashing export.

## 2026-06-03 — Top-layer UI (§7.5): Popover / Tooltip / Dialog, lazy floating-ui, threaded overflow

**Status: IMPLEMENTED 2026-06-03** (Phase 4 Task 4i — see PROGRESS.md). All gates green.

Scope settled with Cutter (AskUserQuestion + the show-more follow-up):
- **Full §7.5 surface** (not simplest-first): `Popover` + wired show-mores + standalone `Tooltip` +
  modal `Dialog`. Cutter chose to build ahead of every consumer (Tooltip/Dialog have no internal
  consumer yet; stories demonstrate them).
- **Thread overflow events through the show-more slots** (a public prop-type change): `MonthShowMoreProps`
  / `TimeShowMoreProps` became generic `<TEvent>` and gained `events: ReadonlyArray<ShowMoreEvent<TEvent>>`
  (new exported `ShowMoreEvent = {key,event,title}`). The default show-mores render a `Popover` listing the
  hidden events. Rejected "label/count only" (would leave the default popover empty).
- **Lazy-load floating-ui on first open** (not direct import): `floatingPosition.ts` dynamically
  `import('@floating-ui/core')` the first time a surface opens. Verified in the dist build — externalized +
  a single dynamic import → out of the initial bundle.

Engineering decisions:
- **Plan vs. locked-decision reconciliation:** the plan §7.5 calls floating-ui a *"fallback … lazy-loaded
  behind feature detection"* for when Anchor Positioning is missing. The **locked DECISIONS entry
  (2026-06-02) supersedes that**: floating-ui is the **permanent default** positioning engine (Anchor
  Positioning is Chromium-only). Implemented per the locked decision; flagged the stale plan prose to Cutter.
  "Lazy-loaded" is honored as a bundle optimization (dynamic import on first open), not as feature-detection.
- **Minimal DOM platform for `@floating-ui/core`:** `computePosition` needs a caller-supplied `platform`
  (core has no DOM knowledge). Because our surfaces live in the top layer (viewport-relative, `strategy:
  'fixed'`), we supply only `getElementRects`/`getDimensions`/`getClippingRect` from `getBoundingClientRect`
  + the viewport box — the small footprint the decision intends, **no `@floating-ui/dom`**. Middleware
  `[offset, flip, shift, size]`; `size` both viewport-constrains big popovers and is what calls
  `getDimensions` (so the required platform method is covered).
- **Popover = declarative `popovertarget`** (not imperative show/hide). jsdom 29 has **no** Popover/dialog
  imperative API and **no `ToggleEvent`** (probed empirically), and `popover="auto"` + a manual onClick
  double-fires against native light-dismiss. So the trigger carries `popovertarget`, the browser owns
  open/close/light-dismiss/Esc, and React only reads the panel's `toggle` event (via the `onToggle` prop —
  React wires a direct 'toggle' listener; confirmed in tests) to track open state + position. Tooltip and
  Dialog DO use the imperative API (`popover="manual"` / `showModal`) guarded by `typeof` (no-op when absent).
- **Shared `useFloatingAnchor` hook:** extracted the open→position→reposition→cleanup effect out of Popover
  and Tooltip. Concentrates the floating-ui wiring and makes the defensive empty-ref guards directly
  unit-testable (pass `{current:null}` refs) — which is how the per-file 85% branch bar is met for these
  small components.
- **Tap-reachable Tooltip (§7.7):** opens on hover **and** focus, **toggles on tap** — no hover-only
  affordance, so it works on coarse-pointer/touch.
- **Storybook show-more demonstrability (Cutter's note):** the existing stories had no day with enough
  events to surface "+N more". Added a `React/Calendar → ShowMorePopover` story (clustered events +
  `weekEventLimit={2}`) instead of mutating the shared `demoEvents` (kept the other stories' intent intact).
- **No jest-dom:** the suite uses plain matchers (`getAttribute().toBe()`, `toBeTruthy()`); native-API
  branches are covered by mocking `showPopover`/`hidePopover`/`showModal` onto the prototype via a typed
  `as unknown as {…}` cast (the `no-explicit-any` lint bars `as any`).

## 2026-06-03 — Month "+N more" is PER-DAY, not per-week (Cutter)

**Status: IMPLEMENTED 2026-06-03** (Task 4i follow-up — see PROGRESS.md).

- **Decision (Cutter):** the month overflow indicator must appear **inside the specific day cell that
  overflowed** (Google/Outlook + v1 react-big-calendar behavior), not once at the week's start. Cutter
  caught this in the Storybook `ShowMorePopover` story — events were on Jun 15 but "+3 more" rendered under
  Jun 14 (the week's first column).
- **Root cause (pre-existing, NOT from §7.5):** core models month overflow **per week** (`MonthWeek.extra`
  is a flat per-week list, from `rowSegments`), and Task 4f's adapter anchored the single indicator to
  `week.days[0]`. §7.5 only turned that existing indicator into a popover.
- **Resolution = adapter + CSS only, NO core change.** `week.extra` segments already carry `left`/`right`
  day-columns, so each overflowed segment's days are derivable. `useMonthWeeks` now computes per-day extra
  (segments whose column span covers that day) onto each `MonthDayCell`; `MonthView` renders one indicator
  per overflowing cell, grid-placed in its column at `moreRow = visibleLevels + 1` via the shared
  `--bc-seg-*` mechanism (`.bc-show-more-cell`). A multi-day overflow shows in each day it spans.
- **What was rejected:** changing the core month model to track per-day overflow (unnecessary — the column
  spans in `week.extra` are sufficient; keeps core's week-level band layout intact for multi-day alignment).
- **Scoped to month only (Cutter):** the time-grid **all-day row** indicator stays single/row-level for now;
  per-day for the all-day row is a larger TimeGridView change to revisit if wanted.

## 2026-06-04 — Selection wiring plan finalized (Cutter)

**Status: PLANNED** (canonical detail in reference repo `Upgrade_plan_prompt.md` §8.1; implementation next).

Discussed RBC's `Selection.js` vs BC's existing 1-D core FSM (`packages/core/src/selection/`, built + unit-tested, NOT yet store-wired). Locked decisions for the upcoming selection-wiring task:

- **Index space:** time body = 1-D vertical slot index per column; **month + all-day row = 1-D linear day-index across the visible grid** (one FSM, no RBC-style 2-D path; "full rows between" falls out).
- **Coordinate mapping:** real focusable DOM cells with `data-*` (`data-date`; time body gains **real per-slot cells** with `data-slot-index`), read via `closest('[data-…]')` — no pixel hit-testing. `'ignoreEvents'` enforced adapter-side via `closest('.bc-event')`.
- **Store surface:** wire one `createSelection` into the store; expose **controller actions + signals** (`start/to/complete/click/doubleClick/cancel`, `state`, `range`). Resets on view change / navigate. Separate from event selection.
- **Double-click:** core FSM **gains `doubleClick({slot})` + `'doubleClick'` SelectAction**; 250 ms click/dbl timing lives in the **adapter** (disambiguated internally so both never fire — fixes RBC's app-side debounce footgun).
- **Public callbacks emit dates:** `onSelecting({start,end})` veto; `onSelectSlot({start,end,slots[],action:'select'|'click'|'doubleClick'})`. **No `bounds`/`box`** pixel rects.
- **Keyboard (new vs RBC, closes a11y gap):** roving tabindex; Arrow=move focus, Shift+Arrow=extend, Enter/Space=commit (complete if selecting else click), Esc=cancel. Home/End/PageUp/Down stay navigation.
- **Touch:** long-press (`longPressThreshold` 250 ms, adapter-timed) + `touch-action`; core pointer-agnostic (§7.7).
- **Overlay:** `.bc-selection` grid-placed — time = vertical `--bc-top`/`--bc-height` box per column; month/all-day = one box per week-row touched (`--bc-seg-*`).
- **Required (Cutter):** a **detailed `.mdx`** in the React Storybook explaining pointer/touch/keyboard selection for manual testing; temporary home in storybook-react, final placement later.
- **Deferred:** per-resource columns / `resourceId` (no resource grouping in BC core yet).

## 2026-06-04 — Event interaction & selection plan finalized (Cutter)

**Status: PLANNED** (canonical detail in reference `Upgrade_plan_prompt.md` §8.2; implementation with the selection task).

Event selection is **separate** from slot selection — different DOM layer, state, and callbacks. State already exists in core (`selected`, `select({id})`, `onSelect`). Locked:

- **`EventButton` (shared react wrapper)** replaces the per-view `.bc-event`/`.bc-segment` wrapper in Month/TimeGrid/Agenda: a real `<button type="button">` with `data-bc-event`, 250 ms click/dbl disambiguation, a11y (accessible name, focus, selected state), stopPropagation. The overridable event slot is presentational content *inside* the button.
- **Click auto-selects + fires callback:** click sets `store.selected = id` AND fires `onEventClick(event)`; double-click fires `onEventDoubleClick(event)`. Both default **noop**, both receive the **full TEvent**. New **store config** callbacks.
- **New names only** (`onEventClick`/`onEventDoubleClick`) — no `onSelectEvent`/`onDoubleClickEvent` aliases; codemods handle RBC rename.
- **Slot-vs-event layering:** two real DOM layers + browser hit-testing; slot handler checks `closest('[data-bc-event]')`. **`selectable: true` and `'ignoreEvents'` BOTH defer to the event** (no drag-select-through-event); simpler than RBC.
- **Open layout item (Cutter):** time-body events fill full column width (`--bc-width: 1`), leaving no empty strip for slot selection at that time → reserve a small **inline-end gutter** on time-grid events during implementation (fallback: honor `selectable:true` to select through events).
- **Keyboard = two roving-tabindex groups:** slot grid (one tab stop) + events (one tab stop, Arrow among events, Enter/Space activates). aria-pressed vs aria-selected finalized with the pattern; documented in the selection `.mdx`.

## 2026-06-04 — Keyboard handling of event double-click (Cutter)

**Status: PLANNED** (detail in reference `Upgrade_plan_prompt.md` §8.2).

There is **no keyboard double-click** (`dblclick` never fires from the keyboard; ARIA has no double-click annotation), so per WCAG 2.1.1 the secondary action needs its own key. On a focused `EventButton`:
- **Enter / Space = primary** → `onEventClick` + select.
- **F2 = secondary** → `onEventDoubleClick` (standard "open/edit focused item" convention).
- Pointer **double-click stays a shortcut** to the same action F2 performs.
- Keys advertised via **`aria-keyshortcuts`**; behavior conveyed via an **`aria-describedby`** visually-hidden instructions element + the selection `.mdx`. (ARIA describes role/state/shortcuts, not gestures.)
- Selected-state attribute (`aria-pressed` vs `aria-selected`) finalized with the events roving-group role.

## 2026-06-04 — Selection wiring: translation home + primitives (Cutter, IMPLEMENTED)

**Status: IMPLEMENTED** (commit c6d3d15 on feat/initial). Resolves two open points from the §8.1 plan that collided at implementation.

- **Index→date translation lives in core/store** (Cutter chose over adapter-side). The 1-D FSM can't translate alone — a time-body slot index needs the **anchor day**. So the store's `selection` API takes the anchor on `start`/`click`/`doubleClick`: `{ slot, date, mode }` where `mode: 'time' | 'day'`. The store captures `{mode, date}`, and on commit translates: **time** = `getSlotDate(anchorDay, dayStartMin + i*step)` per slot with an **exclusive end** (start of the next slot); **day** = linear index into `range.days`, end = **end-of-day** of the last day. Rationale: one translation impl reused by every future framework adapter (vue/angular/lit), instead of re-implemented per adapter.
- **Dates are primitive ISO strings, not JS `Date`** (Cutter corrected the plan's `Date` wording). `onSelectSlot({ start: string, end: string, slots: string[], action })`, `onSelecting({ start: string, end: string }) => boolean | void`. Matches the rest of core (`date` signal, `range.days` are strings).
- **Store surface:** `store.selection` = `{ state, range }` (FSM signals in slot-index space, for the `.bc-selection` overlay) + `start/to/complete/click/doubleClick/cancel`. New `SelectionApi`, `SelectionMode`, `SlotSelectionDates` exported from core. FSM gained `doubleClick` + `'doubleClick'` SelectAction.
- **Reset:** an effect cancels any in-progress drag on view **or** date change (covers navigate/setDate/drilldown/controlled sync).
- **selectable default = false**; captured once at store creation (runtime toggling of `selectable` not yet supported — follow-up if needed for RBC parity).

## 2026-06-04 — EventButton: button reset + aria-selected (Cutter, IMPLEMENTED)

**Status: IMPLEMENTED** (commits ecf0711 slot cells, 58a25c7 EventButton, on feat/initial).

- **Time-body slot cells (ecf0711):** transparent `.bc-time-slots` grid (one `.bc-time-slot` per slot, `data-date` + `data-slot-index`) inside each day column = the base hit/focus layer. Column gradient still paints the lines (Cutter's fix5 styling untouched).
- **EventButton (58a25c7):** internal react wrapper renders each event as a real `<button>` (`data-bc-event`), used in Month + TimeGrid (timed + all-day segments). Click→select+`onEventClick`; dblclick→`onEventDoubleClick` (250ms disambiguation); Enter/Space=primary, F2=secondary (keyboard, immediate via `detail===0` guard); `pointerdown` stopPropagation. `onEventClick`/`onEventDoubleClick` flow CalendarProvider→context (stable identities)→EventButton; kept **react-only** (not core config — core never invokes them).
- **Cutter decisions:** (1) **minimal button reset now** — neutralize native button chrome on `button.bc-event`/`button.bc-segment` (appearance/font-family/text-align) + `:focus-visible` ring; box geometry + skin unchanged. (2) **`aria-selected`** for selected state (events as a roving selectable set), not `aria-pressed`.
- **Deferred:** `aria-describedby` instructions element → step 5 with the messages map + `.mdx`. **Agenda** EventButton not yet wired (its `.bc-agenda-row` layout is more entangled) — flagged for after the slot-selection adapter. Double-click does NOT also select (follows plan's literal primary/secondary split).

## 2026-06-04 — Slot-selection adapter, step 5a: time-grid pointer (Cutter, IMPLEMENTED)

**Status: IMPLEMENTED** (commit 39e4688 on feat/initial). Month/all-day + keyboard still pending.

- **`useSlotSelection(mode)` hook** (react internal): one `onPointerDown` for a selection surface, reads `[data-slot-index]`/`[data-date]` hit cells. press+drag >4px → `start`→`to`→`complete`; press w/o drag → `click`, upgraded to `doubleClick` on a 2nd tap <250ms on the same slot; over `[data-bc-event]` → defer to event; non-primary button / `selectable===false` → ignore. Move/up tracked on `window` (drag can leave the surface); listeners + tap timer cleaned on unmount. Uses `document.elementFromPoint` for the move target (stubbed in tests — jsdom has no layout).
- **TimeGridView** attaches it to `.bc-time-body` and renders `.bc-selection` (existing skin/tokens) in the **anchored column** during a live drag via `selectionStyle({top,height})` from `selection.range`.
- **Store additions:** `selection.anchor` signal (`{mode,date}|null`, set on start/click/dbl, cleared on complete/cancel) so the adapter knows which column/row to highlight; `store.selectable` exposes the resolved mode.
- **Touch:** the threshold-drag works for touch but competes with time-body scroll; true long-press + `touch-action` deferred (the scrollable body can't just be `touch-action:none`). Noted for a later touch pass.
- **Cutter decision:** month/all-day hit targets will use a **dedicated non-overridable hit layer** (`.bc-month-slots` / all-day per-day cells), like the time body — selection survives any `dateCell` override.

## 2026-06-05 — Slot-selection adapter, step 5b: month day selection + storybook demo (Cutter, IMPLEMENTED)

**Status: IMPLEMENTED** (commit 85de055 on feat/initial). All-day row + keyboard still pending.

- **MonthView day-mode selection:** dedicated non-overridable `.bc-month-slots` hit layer (per-day `.bc-month-slot`, `data-date` + linear `weekIndex*7+dayIndex`). The index == `store.range.days` order (verified: `month.function` builds weeks via `days.slice(i,i+7)`), so it maps straight into the store's `'day'` translation. `useSlotSelection('day')` attaches to `.bc-month-grid`.
- **Month overlay:** per-week `.bc-selection.bc-selection-month` band; the live `selection.range` (linear indices) is clipped to each week row (`max(start,base)..min(end,base+6)`) and placed with `segmentStyle({left,span,row:1})`. New CSS `.bc-selection-month` overrides the absolute `.bc-selection` to a grid-placed full-height item.
- **Hit fall-through (edited 2 existing rules, flagged to Cutter):** `.bc-week-backgrounds` → `pointer-events:none` + new `.bc-date-number { pointer-events:auto }`. Empty cell area falls through to the slot layer; date-number drilldown + event clicks stay live. DOM/paint order in a week: slots → selection → backgrounds → events.
- **Storybook (fixes "no selectable control"):** new `SelectionDemo` harness (selectable on; `onSelectSlot`/`onEventClick`/`onEventDoubleClick` → on-screen read-out) + **Selectable** stories on TimeGridView (week) and MonthView.
- Tests: +3 MonthView (hit-cell tags, day-drag band, ISO day-click payload). react **100**, core 144; all gates + storybook green.

## 2026-06-05 — Cross-day time selection → all-day span + `allDay` flag (Cutter, IMPLEMENTED)

**Status: IMPLEMENTED** (commit 0fb17d1 on feat/initial).

- **Capability:** a time-grid drag can start in a timeslot on one day and end on another. Implemented by encoding time-grid hit cells in a **global slot index** (`dayIndex*slotCount + slot`) so the 1-D FSM spans days unchanged. The store decodes both ends: same day → timed selection (as before); different days → a promoted **whole-day span** over `range.days[startDay..endDay]`.
- **`allDay` flag (Cutter decision: all whole-day selections):** `SlotSelectionDates` and `onSelecting` args gain `allDay: boolean` — `true` for month/day selections AND cross-day time drags; `false` for within-day timed selections.
- **`slotCount` plumbing:** flows view → `useSlotSelection('time', grid.slotCount)` → `store.selection.start/click/doubleClick` → anchor, so the store decode matches the grid exactly (no recompute/DST drift). Optional everywhere (`?: number | undefined`); when absent the decode degenerates to single-day (back-compat). Guard: `0 * Infinity = NaN`, so the no-count fallback uses `slotCount = 0` + `startDay/endDay = 0`, not Infinity.
- **Overlay (Cutter decision):** computed per column — start day fills from its slot to the bottom, whole middle days fill, end day fills top→its slot; same-day drag stays a single box. Reuses the existing absolute `.bc-selection`; no new CSS.
- **Cutter's `allDay` definition (correction, commit c3c9a46):** `allDay` = a whole day (00:00–23:59) **or** a multi-day span that **keeps instant time information**. So a cross-day time drag emits `allDay:true` with its **real instant start/end** + the full per-slot `slots` list across the spanned days — NOT flattened to day bounds. Month/day selections stay whole-day (no times). The per-column overlay (slot extents) matches the kept times.
- **Full-day + end-of-day (commit e4366ea):** a same-day drag covering the entire midnight→end-of-day window (`dayStartMin===0 && dayEndMin===1440 && startInDay===0 && endInDay===slotCount-1`) commits as an all-day day-span (midnight → 23:59:59, `slots:[day]`), like a month day-click. And the exclusive end of any selection whose last slot is the final slot of a full day is `endOf(day)` (23:59:59…), not next-day midnight — the next instant is the next day. Partial windows (9–5) still end at their window edge (e.g. 17:00).
- Tests: core cross-day test asserts instant start/end + full slot list; existing time/day payloads carry `allDay`; react TimeGridView cross-day (two overlay boxes + all-day commit, 44 slots). core **146**, react **102**; all gates + storybook green.

## 2026-06-05 — Slot-selection `onSelectSlot`/`onSelecting` contract — FINAL (Cutter) 📝 needs `.mdx`

**Status: LOCKED + IMPLEMENTED** (core store + react TimeGridView/MonthView). Consolidates the 2026-06-04/05 entries above into the authoritative public contract. Mirrored into the plan at `Upgrade_plan_prompt.md` §8.3.

> 📝 **`.mdx` API doc TODO:** this is the canonical selection callback contract — write it into the selection `.mdx` (storybook-react) and the `storybook-core` API docs. Tracked in PROGRESS.md "Step 6 — .mdx".

- **Primitives only:** all selection callbacks emit ISO **strings**, never `Date`.
- **Payload `SlotSelectionDates`:** `{ start: string; end: string; slots: string[]; action: 'select'|'click'|'doubleClick'; allDay: boolean }`. `onSelecting({start,end,allDay}) => boolean|void` (veto with `false`). `end` is **exclusive**.
- **`allDay` definition (Cutter):** an entire-day span (`00:00:00→23:59:59`) **or** a multi-day span that **keeps instant time information**. Resolution:
  - within-day timed drag/click → `allDay:false`, real instants, `slots`=each slot.
  - full-day drag (full midnight→EOD window + every slot) → `allDay:true`, midnight→`23:59:59`, `slots:[day]`.
  - cross-day time drag → `allDay:true`, **kept instant** start/end, `slots`=each slot across days (NOT flattened).
  - month / day-grid → `allDay:true`, day bounds, `slots`=day-starts.
- **End-of-day rule:** last slot of a **full** day → exclusive end = `endOf(day)` (`23:59:59.999`), not next-day midnight. Partial windows (9–5) end at their edge.
- **Mechanism:** time cells use a **global** index `dayIndex*slotCount+slot`; `slotCount` flows view→hook→store anchor; store decodes day+slot. Per-column overlay (start-day slot→bottom, full middle, top→end-day slot).

## 2026-06-05 — Selection a11y: `aria-describedby` instructions + string home (Cutter, IMPLEMENTED)

**Status: IMPLEMENTED** (feat/initial). Closes Step 6 of the §8.1/§8.2 selection plan; resolves the deferred "aria-describedby instructions element" from the 2026-06-04 keyboard entries.

- **String home (Cutter chose via AskUserQuestion): the CORE `Messages` map**, not a react-only constant. Two new overridable keys: `selectionInstructions` (slot grid) and `eventInstructions` (event buttons). Rationale: a11y gesture text localizes alongside every other string and every future adapter inherits it. English defaults describe Arrow / Shift+Arrow / Enter–Space / Esc, and Enter–Space / F2.
- **Single shared text per kind:** `CalendarProvider` renders two visually-hidden `<p class="bc-sr-only">` elements (ids from `useId()`) and publishes `descriptionIds: { selection, event }` on the context. Every slot cell + every `EventButton` points `aria-describedby` at the **same** element — one source of truth, no per-cell duplication of the string.
- **On the focusable nodes, not the container:** describedby sits on the roving slot cells (`.bc-month-slot`/`.bc-allday-slot`/`.bc-time-slot`) and on each `EventButton`, so a screen reader announces it on focus. Putting it on the grid container would need ARIA grid roles to be announced — those stay deferred to §7.6.
- **`.bc-sr-only` is unscoped** (not under `.bc-calendar`) because the provider may render the instruction elements alongside, not inside, the calendar root. clip-path visually-hidden, in `@layer bc.layout`.
- **Docs:** new `storybook-core` `Core/Selection contract` page mirrors the framework-agnostic callback/`SlotSelectionDates` contract (the §8.3 "mirror into storybook-core" TODO); react `Selection.mdx` notes the instructions + the two message keys.
- **Minor deferred:** slot cells stay focusable + describedby even when `selectable===false` (selection instructions announced on a non-selectable grid). Low-stakes; gate later if wanted.

## 2026-06-05 — View registry (2m) custom-view model contract = Option B (Cutter, DESIGN ONLY — not yet built)

**Status: DIRECTION DECIDED, IMPLEMENTATION STILL DEFERRED.** Closes the open design question in PROGRESS.md "Next — open design decisions #1". The registry build stays a Phase-4 task (coupled to the React view-component contract); this entry only fixes *which* model contract we build when we do.

- **Decision (Cutter, via AskUserQuestion): Option B — open `custom` arm + plugin builder.** When the registry lands, `CalendarViewModel<TEvent>` gains **one additive arm** `{ kind: 'custom'; view: ViewKey; model: <plugin type> }`; the registry entry supplies a **pure `buildModel` that runs in core** (shared by every adapter, unit-testable like the built-ins), typed via a generic on the registry entry so the matching React view-component reads `model: TModel`.
- **Rejected:** **A (reuse an existing kind)** — most type-safe + zero union change, but can only express month-/time-/agenda-shaped layouts; a genuinely new view (year, custom timeline) can't be modeled. **D (render-only passthrough)** — simplest, but breaks the architecture promise that the model lives in core so all adapters emit identical output (each adapter would re-implement the custom layout). **Fully-generic threaded `TModel`** — heavy generics through the store signal for little gain over B.
- **Seams a registry must cover (all currently a closed `switch` over `ViewKey`):** `viewRange` (range), `navigateDate`/`stepFor` (PREV/NEXT step), `viewLabel` (toolbar title), `buildViewModel` (model). Registry maps `ViewKey → { range, navigate, label, buildModel }`; each seam falls through to `registry[view]` in a `default` branch.
- **Known cost (accepted):** widening `ViewKey` from the closed `BuiltinViewKey` union to admit `string` removes the exhaustive-`switch` type safety each seam currently relies on; every seam needs a runtime `default`/throw. Unavoidable for any registry.

## 2026-06-05 — Time-grid event gutter: selectable trailing strip (Cutter, IMPLEMENTED)

**Status: IMPLEMENTED** (styles, CSS-only). Closes the "full-width timed event leaves no selectable slot strip" open item.

- **Problem:** an unoverlapped timed event is `--bc-left:0`/`--bc-width:1`, so its absolute box covered the full inline width of the day column; no `.bc-time-slot` was grabbable at the event's times → the RBC "start a selection alongside an existing event" affordance was impossible.
- **Approach (Cutter chose CSS-only over baking into core day-layout widths):** new `--bc-event-gutter` token; the `.bc-event, .bc-bg-event` rule squeezes the fractional layout into `100% - var(--bc-event-gutter)` (both `inset-inline-start` and `inline-size` multiplied by `(100% - gutter)`), reserving a permanent strip on the trailing (inline-end) edge over a bare slot. **Rejected core-math approach:** it would change core's pure output for every adapter and mix a presentational affordance into the data contract.
- **Size (Cutter): `0.625rem`** (≈10px, rem so it scales with root font-size/zoom; matches the other rem layout tokens). Overridable via the token.
- **No core/geometry/JS change, no `SlotSelectionDates` change.** **Verification:** jsdom has no box model / working `elementFromPoint`, so there is no meaningful Vitest test for "the strip is grabbable" — verified visually via `build-storybook` (green). Expected, not an omission.

## 2026-06-05 — Touch slot selection: long-press gate + scroll suppression (Cutter, IMPLEMENTED)

**Status: IMPLEMENTED** (core config + React adapter + styles). Closes the carried "touch long-press + `touch-action` (scrollable body)" open item.

- **Problem:** the pointer adapter started a drag immediately on press; on touch that fights native scroll (the browser fires `pointercancel`, not clean `pointermove`), so drag-select on a finger was effectively broken and there was no way to scroll the time body without risking a stray selection.
- **Decision — gate touch selection behind a long-press** (Cutter chose **configurable `longPressThreshold`, default 500 ms**, over a fixed constant): on `pointerType === 'touch'`, a press arms a timer; the selection begins only when the finger is held still that long. Movement past the 4px drag threshold *before* the timer fires is read as a scroll → the gesture is abandoned silently (no select, no click). Mouse/pen are untouched — they still start a drag immediately on movement. **Rejected:** 500ms/250ms fixed constants (less flexible); 250ms (matches old RBC `longPressThreshold` but too easy to trigger while scrolling).
- **Decision — robust scroll suppression** (Cutter chose this over CSS-only): `touch-action: pan-y` on `.bc-time-body` lets a finger scroll normally *before* engage; on engage the adapter `setPointerCapture`s the pointer and attaches a **non-passive `touchmove` `preventDefault`** so native scroll stops for the rest of the drag. CSS `touch-action` alone can't do this (it's locked at gesture start and can't be toggled mid-drag). **Rejected CSS-only (v1):** a vertical drag-select would still scroll the body.
- **Where it lives:** `longPressThreshold` is core config (`config.type.ts`) → resolved on the store (`store.type.ts`, `createCalendarStore`, default 500) → read by the React `useSlotSelection` adapter, so every framework adapter shares the contract/default. The timing/capture/`touchmove` logic is adapter-only (core selection FSM is pure slot-index space and unaware of input device, per its own header).
- **Also:** `pointercancel` now aborts an in-progress range (`store.selection.cancel()`), not just detaches listeners — fixes a would-be stale highlight if the browser revokes the pointer mid-drag.
- **Adapter restructure:** `useSlotSelection` moved from two shared `useCallback` handlers to **gesture-local closures** created per pointerdown (with a `tap` ref for the cross-gesture double-click debounce and an `activeTeardown` ref for unmount cleanup). Required to add `pointercancel` + the long-press timer without circular `useCallback` deps; mouse/pen behavior is byte-for-byte preserved (all prior tests pass unchanged).
- **Verification:** touch timing/abandon/tap/custom-threshold/pointercancel/pointer-capture all unit-tested with fake timers (jsdom propagates `pointerType`/`pointerId`); `setPointerCapture` is stubbed in one test since jsdom throws. Per-file coverage 85.2% branch / 100% func. The *scroll-suppression effect itself* (like all CSS hit-testing) is only visually verifiable — `build-storybook` green.

## 2026-06-05 — Agenda event interaction + new right/middle-click handlers (Cutter, IMPLEMENTED)

**Status: IMPLEMENTED** (React adapter + provider/context + styles + docs). Closes the carried "Agenda EventButton" open item — by deliberately **not** reusing the shared `EventButton`.

- **Decision — agenda does NOT reuse `EventButton`; the title is the interactive target, conditionally (Cutter).** The agenda is a list (no drag, no resize, no selection), and its `.bc-agenda-row` is a CSS **subgrid** participant — wrapping the row in a `<button>` would break the date|time|event column alignment (subgrid only inherits through a direct parent→child grid relationship). So the row DOM is kept and only `.bc-agenda-event` (the title) becomes interactive: a real `<button>` (styled as a **link**) when the app wired ≥1 event handler, otherwise a plain non-interactive `<span>`. **Rejected:** (a) make the button the whole `.bc-agenda-row` (breaks subgrid + changes the `components.agenda.event` override contract); (b) reuse `EventButton` unconditionally (always a button, brings `aria-selected`/store selection the agenda has no use for).
- **Decision — bespoke `AgendaEventButton` keeps the keyboard double-click equivalent (Cutter).** Wires click→`onEventClick`, dblclick→`onEventDoubleClick` (250ms debounce, like EventButton), Enter/Space→primary, **F2**→secondary. **No `aria-selected`** (nothing to select). **No `aria-describedby`**: the shared `eventInstructions` message says "use the arrow keys to move between events" (the grids' roving model), which is wrong for the agenda — keys advertised via `aria-keyshortcuts` instead.
- **Decision — agenda keyboard = natural tab order, not roving (Cutter).** Each title button is its own tab stop (default `tabIndex`); `Tab` walks them. The grids' single arrow-roving tab stop (`useEventRoving`) is for dense/scattered events; a vertical list reads better as ordinary tab order. No roving hook in the agenda.
- **Decision — new public handlers `onEventRightClick` / `onEventMiddleClick`, signature `(event, domEvent)` (Cutter named + chose signature).** Added to `CalendarProps`; wired on **both** the shared `EventButton` (Month/TimeGrid) and the agenda element. Right = `onContextMenu` (also fires on the keyboard Menu key / Shift+F10 and touch long-press — free keyboard parity); middle = `onAuxClick` + `e.button === 1` (modern browsers route non-primary buttons to `auxclick`, not `click`). Both get the **DOM event** so the app can read `clientX/clientY` and `preventDefault()` to position/replace a context menu — **the app owns preventDefault; the library does not auto-suppress** the native menu. Middle-click is pointer-only (no keyboard equivalent, like middle-click everywhere). **Rejected names:** `onRightClick`/`onScrollClick` (break the `onEvent*` prefix; "scroll click" is non-standard — the DOM calls it the middle/auxiliary button). **Rejected signature:** `(event)` only (no cursor position → no positioned context menu possible).
- **Detection mechanism:** the context previously exposed only always-defined noop-safe handler wrappers, so nothing could tell "app passed a handler" from "passed nothing." Added `hasEventHandler: boolean` to `CalendarContextValue` (OR of all four handlers' presence, computed in `CalendarProvider` from the raw props) — the agenda reads it for button-vs-span. Two new stable wrappers (`onEventRightClick`/`onEventMiddleClick`) added to context alongside the existing two.
- **Scope:** the new handlers are React-layer props (like `onEventClick`/`onEventDoubleClick`) handled by `CalendarProvider`, NOT core `CalendarConfig` — no core change. `<Calendar>` only reads context, so no Calendar-component change.
- **Verification:** EventButton + AgendaView unit tests (right via `contextMenu`, middle via a dispatched `auxclick` MouseEvent since `fireEvent.auxClick` is absent in this TL version, contextmenu, keyboard, span-vs-button, only-right-click-promotes, natural tab order). Per-file AgendaEventButton 100%/100%, EventButton 96.2%/100%, CalendarProvider 100%/100%. Lint + storybook green.
- **⚠ Carried blocker (NOT introduced here):** `useSlotSelection.test.tsx:282-283` (prior session's touch pointer-capture stub) fails `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` typecheck — restoring a possibly-`undefined` value into the optional `proto.setPointerCapture`. Every file in THIS change typechecks clean. Left untouched pending Cutter's OK (it's an unrelated file).

## 2026-06-05 — Right/middle-click handlers gated, not noop-wrapped (Cutter, refinement of the entry above)

**Status: IMPLEMENTED.** Refines the agenda/right-middle-click decision: the new `onEventRightClick`/`onEventMiddleClick` are exposed on context as `((event, domEvent) => void) | undefined` — the **stable wrapper only when the app passed a handler, else `undefined`**. `EventButton` + `AgendaEventButton` attach `onContextMenu`/`onAuxClick` only when the field is present, so an omitted right-click handler leaves the browser's **native context menu untouched** (no listener at all). Left-click/double-click keep their always-defined noop-safe wrappers (left-click still drives `store.select`).

- **Why (Cutter):** "there shouldn't be a noop for `onEventRightClick` — it could affect the browser's native context menu; if configured use it, otherwise undefined." Note: the prior always-attached noop did **not** call `preventDefault`, so it didn't actually suppress the menu — but gating is the correct/cleaner design and removes the needless listener.
- **Mechanism:** provider computes `hasRightClick`/`hasMiddleClick` (presence of the raw prop) and exposes `hasRightClick ? handleEventRightClick : undefined` (stable wrapper preserves identity when present; flips only on presence change → no context churn from inline handlers). `hasEventHandler` (the agenda button-vs-span gate) unchanged (OR of all four).
- **Symmetry:** applied to middle-click too (same noop-wrapper shape) even though a noop `auxclick` has no native side effect — keeps the context shape consistent.
- **Tests:** added "leaves the native context menu untouched when no handler is wired" (asserts `contextmenu` `defaultPrevented === false`) for both EventButton and the agenda. Per-file: AgendaEventButton 100%/100%, EventButton 96.7%/100%, CalendarProvider 100%/100%.

## 2026-06-07 — Slot/event handler separation; move event handlers into core (Cutter)

Cutter's separation-of-concerns refactor, superseding the 2026-06-06 React-layer event-handler placement and the right/middle-gating entry above (the gating principle survives; the placement moved to core).

- **Premise correction (load-bearing):** `store.select({id})` was already **event** selection (fires the old `onSelect`); **slot** selection lives under `store.selection.*`. The pain was the `select`/`selection` homonym in the core store, not the direction Cutter first assumed.
- **Two focused concerns, both core-owned:**
  - **Event interaction** moved INTO `CalendarConfig`: `onEventClick` / `onEventDoubleClick` / `onEventRightClick` / `onEventMiddleClick`. Exposed on the store as **`store.eventHandlers`** (`EventHandlerApi<TEvent>`): presence flags `has`/`hasRightClick`/`hasMiddleClick` + methods `click`/`doubleClick`/`rightClick`/`middleClick` (fire-if-defined; **no noop**).
  - **Slot selection** callbacks renamed for parity: `onSelecting` → `onSlotSelecting`; `onSelectSlot` (single + `action`) **split** into `onSlotClick`/`onSlotDoubleClick`/`onSlotSelect`. `action` **removed** from `SlotSelectionDates` (the firing callback encodes the gesture).
  - Event-selection action `store.select` → **`store.selectEvent`**; notify `onSelect` → **`onEventSelect`**.
- **`domEvent` = global `MouseEvent`** (Cutter rec "go with your recs"): web-standard, available because `tsconfig.base` already has `lib: [...,"DOM",...]`; core stays framework-agnostic (no React synthetic, no DOM *listeners*). React adapter passes `e.nativeEvent`. Rejected: a core-owned minimal pointer interface (purer but bespoke type for apps) — revisit only if we want core 100% DOM-type-free.
- **`eventHandlers.click` does NOT select.** Selection is composed by the caller: grid `EventButton` = `selectEvent` + `click`; agenda = `click` alone. **Why:** the agenda has no selection (Cutter, locked) — folding selection into `click` would make agenda clicks mutate `store.selected` (invisible there, but it would leak across views). Whether a view selects is a per-view policy, so the adapter composes the two core primitives.
- **Presence resolved once at store creation** (handlers are config, fixed for the store's lifetime). Trade-off: an app that conditionally *adds* a handler after mount won't flip the agenda span→button or wire a late `contextmenu` listener. Accepted — matches how the slot callbacks already behave (wrap-when-provided in `useCalendar`); flagged to Cutter. Revisit with reactive-presence signals only if dynamic toggling is needed.
- **Adapter is now a dumb translator:** `CalendarProvider` no longer wraps/tracks event handlers (flow through `...props` → `useCalendar` → core config, identity kept stable by `useCalendar`'s existing ref). Context dropped its `onEvent*`/`hasEventHandler` fields; `EventButton`/`AgendaEventButton` read `store.eventHandlers`. `CalendarProps` inherits the handler types from `CalendarConfig`.
- **Gates:** typecheck core+react ✓; core 151 + react 151 tests ✓; per-file coverage all touched files clear the 85/95 bar; lint ✓; build-storybook core+react ✓. Split-callback tests use a `slotSpy()` helper that fans the three into one spy and re-injects `action`, preserving the gesture assertions.

## 2026-06-07 — Event double-click also selects (Cutter)

Resolves the long-carried "double-click-also-selects (needs a UX decision first)" open item.

- **Decision (Cutter):** in the grid views, a **double-click / F2** on an event now **selects** it (updates `store.selected`, fires `onEventSelect`) in addition to firing `onEventDoubleClick` — matching the single-click/Enter/Space primary path. Previously only the primary gesture selected.
- **Scope:** grid views only. The **agenda stays the exception** (no selection at all) — confirmed still correct; `AgendaEventButton` continues to call `eventHandlers.doubleClick(event)` alone, with no `selectEvent`.
- **Mechanism:** `EventButton` factors a shared `select()` (the `if (id != null) store.selectEvent({ id })` step) called by **both** `primary()` and `secondary()`. `eventHandlers.click`/`doubleClick` still do NOT select (core stays selection-agnostic per the 2026-06-07 separation decision); selection remains a per-view side-effect composed by the adapter.
- **Tests/docs:** EventButton double-click + F2 tests now assert `aria-selected === 'true'`; `Selection.mdx` keyboard table (F2 row) + a new note state both grid gestures select (agenda excepted).
- **Gates:** typecheck core+react ✓; core 151 + react 151 ✓; lint ✓; react build-storybook ✓.

## 2026-06-07 — View registry (2m) CORE implemented; React render path still open (Cutter)

Implements the Option B contract decided 2026-06-05 (that entry was DESIGN ONLY). **Core only** — the React rendering of a custom view is a separate, still-open decision (below).

- **Scope (core):** widened `ViewKey` to `BuiltinViewKey | (string & {})`; added the `{ kind:'custom'; view; model: unknown }` arm to `CalendarViewModel`; added `ViewDefinition`/`ViewRegistry`/`ViewRegistrySeams` types + the `defineView` inference helper; threaded a `registry?` through all four seams (`viewRange`/`navigateDate`/`viewLabel`/`buildViewModel`), each consulting `registry[view]` **only** in a new `default` branch (built-ins stay hardcoded) and throwing for an unknown key; added `CalendarConfig.views?` and wired it through `createCalendarStore`.
- **`ViewRegistrySeams`:** the non-model seams (`range`/`navigate`/`label`) don't touch `TEvent`, so they accept this `Pick<…,'range'|'navigate'|'label'>` slice — keeps `viewRange`/`navigateDate`/`viewLabel` non-generic while still type-checking a passed registry (a generic `ViewRegistry<TEvent>` would have caused `buildModel` contravariance grief).
- **`navigateDate`:** `stepFor` now returns `undefined` for non-built-ins; TODAY/DATE stay universal (handled before the view is consulted), so a custom `ViewDefinition.navigate` only computes its PREV/NEXT step.
- **`buildViewModel`:** gained `date`/`resources` params (forwarded to a custom `buildModel`; built-ins ignore them). `model` is erased to `unknown` on the union; `defineView` lets a component recover `TModel`.
- **React fallout (from the widening, fixed here):** `DefaultToolbar` could no longer index `messages[option:ViewKey]` → now `viewButtonLabel()` returns the localized message for a built-in else the raw view key. `<Calendar>` uses boolean `kind ===` checks (not an exhaustive switch) so the new `custom` kind compiled fine; it currently renders **nothing** for a custom view — by design, pending the render-path decision.
- **STILL OPEN (do not guess — surfaced to Cutter):** how React registers + renders a `kind:'custom'` view and reads its `TModel`. Options: (a) `components.views: Record<string, ComponentType>` consumed by `<Calendar>`'s dispatch; (b) render-prop/children-as-function; (c) one registration object pairing the core `ViewDefinition` with its React component. No default chosen.
- **Gates:** core typecheck/test (163)/lint/build ✓; react typecheck/test (151)/lint/build ✓; build-storybook core+react ✓.

## 2026-06-07 — View registry (2m) REACT render path = Option A, components.views map (Cutter)

Completes 2m. Cutter chose **Option A** (AskUserQuestion) over a render-prop (B) or a paired core+React registration object (C).

- **Decision:** custom views render via a **`components.views: Record<viewKey, ComponentType<CustomViewProps>>`** map on the existing `CalendarComponents` override surface. `<Calendar>` reads `components` from context and, for `viewModel.kind === 'custom'`, renders `components.views[viewModel.view]` inside `.bc-calendar` (nothing if unregistered).
- **Why A:** mirrors the established per-slot override pattern (toolbar / month / time / agenda); keeps the core `views` config **React-free** (the pure `ViewDefinition` stays in core config; the React component lives in the React `components` prop). Rejected **C** because it would put a React `ComponentType` into the config object handed to core's `createCalendarStore`; rejected **B** (render-prop) because one function for all custom views doesn't compose with the components map.
- **Component contract refinement:** the custom view component **receives `{ view, model }` as props** (`CustomViewProps`, `model: unknown`) rather than re-reading the model from context (the AskUserQuestion preview sketched a context read). Props are more ergonomic + unit-testable; the component casts `model` to the `TModel` it produced via `defineView`.
- **Gates:** react typecheck/test (153)/lint/build ✓; build-storybook react ✓. New `React/Calendar → CustomView` story + 2 Calendar tests (renders via the map / renders nothing when unregistered).

## 2026-06-07 — §7.7 coarse-pointer/touch CSS pass (Cutter, IMPLEMENTED)

Styles-side of §7.7 (touch behaviour — long-press + time-body `touch-action` — already shipped with selection wiring). CSS/docs only.

- **Hit targets:** new `--bc-touch-target` token (44px) applied under `@media (pointer: coarse), (hover: none)` (new `components/coarse-pointer.css`) to **discrete** controls only: toolbar buttons, `.bc-date-number`/`.bc-day-heading` drilldowns, `.bc-show-more`, `button.bc-agenda-event`.
- **Deliberately excluded:** geometry-sized `.bc-event`/`.bc-segment` and the slot cells — their size encodes duration / the slot grid, so forcing 44px would corrupt the time-grid/month layout. Their actions remain reachable by tap / long-press. (Decision: enlarge controls, not data-driven boxes.)
- **`touch-action: pan-y`** extended from `.bc-time-body` to the other selectable surfaces `.bc-month-grid` + `.bc-allday-row` so a day-mode drag-select doesn't fight native scroll/zoom.
- **No new unit test:** jsdom has no box model or media emulation; verified via `nx build styles` + `build-storybook react`. The Playwright touch-emulation gate (§7.7) is a CI concern out of scope here; drag-handle `touch-action: none` belongs to `@big-calendar/dnd` (unbuilt).

## 2026-06-07 — Selection Storybook split docs (Cutter, IMPLEMENTED)

Closes the carried Phase-4 obligation (bigcal-selection-storybook-phase4): the React Storybook must clearly document the core-FSM ↔ adapter-mapping selection split. Docs only.

- **`Selection.mdx`** — new "Architecture: core FSM ↔ adapter mapping" section: a 3-layer table (core `createSelection` FSM in slot-index space / core store index→ISO-date translation / the React adapter as the only DOM-touching layer), the pointer-drag round trip, the keyboard path on the same FSM, and the rationale (one behaviour across adapters, isolation testing, view-owned geometry). Added **after** the existing "Under the hood" section — that prose was left intact (no rewrite).
- **`SelectionContract.mdx`** (core) — added a cross-reference to the React Architecture section.
- **Gate:** build-storybook core + react ✓.
